## Getting Started

Fetch the entire Geometrize codebase by executing the [get_geometrize_projects.sh](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/geometrize-top-level-repo/blob/master/get_geometrize_projects.sh) script.

The Geometrize project is split across numerous git repositories and submodules, since it comprises several separate software projects, and for the sake of modularity.

To contribute, please make a pull request or open an issue on the relevant repository. Write access to repositories can also be granted to trusted contributors.
